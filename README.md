# MIT6.0002
## Course information
* **Course title:** MIT 6.0002 Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science
* I attended this course on MIT ocw in April and June 2020. I found it not only a well-organised foundamental phython course, but also a great introduction to several widely used algortithms, statistical tools related to computer science and basics of machine learning models. The best thing about the course is the problem sets, which are interesting and challenging enough for starters. By attending this course, I brushed up my phython skills and developed interests in a couple of areas where I will dig deeper.
